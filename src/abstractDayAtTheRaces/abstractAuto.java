/*
 * abstractAuto is an abstract class to be used in ICS4U
 * 
 * The variables define some key aspects of an auto such as:
 * the number of wheels, the current speed, the maximum speed,
 * the rate of acceleration, the race position, and the progress in a race
 * 
 * The methods are getSpeed which returns the current speed,
 * drive which moves the auto along the course and decelerates due to friction,
 * boolean finishedRace when the auto's race progress exceeds the race length
 * 
 * And abstract methods: accelerate and getType,
 * accelerate increases the current speed of the auto,
 * getType returns the type of the auto as a String- useful for output.
 *
