/*
 * Car is an implementation of abstractAuto used in Race.java
 * the default constructor initializes the variables declared in 
 * abstractAuto, the second constructor takes the car's acceleration as input
 * 
 * Car overrides the abstract methods accelerate and getType quite simply:
 * accelerate increases the car's speed by 80% of the acceleration, getType
 *  returns "Car"
